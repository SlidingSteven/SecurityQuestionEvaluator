Few if Any Good Security Questions  The term “security questions” is a misnomer.
Security questions are not secure, but instead create a potential hole or breach in security by providing ways for users to gain unauthorized access.
People share considerable personal information on social networking sites, mobile tools, and blogs making it increasingly easier to find information on people.
Hopefully, security experts will create better ways of authentication and forgotten passwords.
Until then security questions will likely prevail.
Also, there are few if any “good” security questions; most are fair or bad.
A good question would rate high on all five criteria with a total of 13 or 14 (5 criteria on a scale of 1-3).
There’s not one question in my list that rated a total of 15.
The reality is, few questions qualify as “good” and  even the best security questions are not good enough to screen out all attacks.
There is a trade-off; self-service vs.
security.
