## TODO
* Research common security questions and determine what is weak/strong
...Compile a list of websites that use security questions.  Looking for banks, emails, social media accounts for a starting point.
...Google has done research on this that may be useful for getting started.
* Build a flask app to evaluate all questions on a website given a URL
...User should input a url and we will automatically scrape the HTML on the page using Python to find security questions and extract them.  
...* We will need to first make a simple flask app
...* Next need some front end constructed
...* Start small and evaluate a question on input
...* Eventually get rid of the question on input and just use a URL or html upload, if possible.  I have a concern if we will be able to see the page contents at that point or if they will be locked and need a password to get to.  Maybe we will need to upload a file.
