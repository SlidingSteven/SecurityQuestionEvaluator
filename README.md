## How To Run
This flask app runs on Python 3.  When I downloaded Python 3 it makes me use "python3" in the shell to run it, some people may only need to use 'python'.  You can use pipenv to install dependencies and activate the shell-

```
python3 -m pipenv install 
python3 -m pipenv shell
```

Next navigate to the folder with the file app.py and run
```
python3 app.py
```
